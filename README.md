FB sent a C&amp;D letter to https://github.com/Morhaus/facebook-sixth-sense

yolo here's the code. FB sucks.
Got the extension from: /Users/calefornia/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/{id}

This still works, so enable dev mode and load this as an unpacked extension. (you probably already knew that :)

Mark, you are bad for the internet. I don't like you.
